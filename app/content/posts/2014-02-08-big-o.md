## BIG O

It is a way to measure time complexity and space complexity of algorithms.

1. Time complexity is measured based on how many steps an algorithm executes to finish its work.
1. Space complexity is measured based on how many space in memory a data algorithm occupies.


#### Types of Big O Measurement

1. Omega
1. Theta
1. Omacron aka O as in Big O

```bash
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```
e.g. to check the time complexty for an array of 7 elements, we would use a `for loop` so 
in this case, If looking for number 1, this is our best case (Omega), number 7 would be the worst (O) case and average case would be number 4 (theta).
